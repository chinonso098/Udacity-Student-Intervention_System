# Udacity-Student-Intervention-System-Overview
This project utilizes supervised machine learning models to predict which students from a given data set are at risk of failing

Model Selection for the Student Intervention System

This project is for the Udacity course on Supervised Learning

#Objective

The goal is to identify students who might need early intervention using Supervise Learning. The performance metric will be defined. A variety algorithms will be evaluated regarding the performance metric and running time.

#Usage

Put all the file in the root directory
run the "student_intervention.py" in ipython notebook
#Software and library requirement:

Python 2.7
Libraries:Sklearn , Pandas , Numpy
